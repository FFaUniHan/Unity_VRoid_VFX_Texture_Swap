# Unity VRoid Import to 3D Template Tutorial
This project is a ready-to-use Standard 3D template with UniVRM plugin installed. This project uses Unity version 2021.2.3f, earlier versions of Unity might not work and later versions might break some of the scripts. I made this publicly available because some people have reported in my video comment section that they are unable to get the UniVRM plugin to install properly.

Huge credit to these guys who made this possible!

# Instructions
Once you download and extract the zip file or clone the project to your Git application, open it in Unity Hub. This project uses Unity version 2021.2.3f, earlier versions of Unity might not work and later versions might break some of the scripts. To download a specific version of Unity, go to this website https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive. After you download and install the Unity version, you can add this version of Unity back to Unity Hub and open it.

When you first open this project, Unity will generate all necessary files. it could take a while, so relax, play your favorite song, and grab a coffee or tea! Once it's opened in Unity and it looks exactly like in the screenshot, you're all set!

Alternatively, you could create your own Standard 3D project in Unity Hub and then install the Unity package.

This is how the project should look like:

I've set up a walking animation and several scripts from my lateet tutorials:
